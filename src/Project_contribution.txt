My contribution in the project was from initial brainstorming, relevant literature review to perform dynamic analysis on the malware where I created a Inetsim service which acted as an internet network which helped us to achieve a sandbox environment. Once this was done, I used WireShark to sniff the packets which were being sent by the malware over the network and was able to detect some files which were being downloaded by the malware. I also contributed in creating a virtual environment for running the malware and analysing.
